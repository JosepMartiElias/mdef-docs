## Syllabus

Applying curatorial practice participants will have the opportunity to think about and develop tools for contextualising, positioning and framing their work as part of new narratives. They will be invited to analyze and synthesize their own work independently and as part of their peer group, in a variety of formats and in small and larger group collaboration. By exploring and broadening their frame of references and presenting compelling propositions for alternative futures, participants will experience and develop curatorial perspectives and tools.

## Deliverables

Presentation of exhibition proposals and event format concept.

Guillem Camprodon is a designer and technologist working on projects bridging emergent technologies and grassroots communities. He is the director of Fab Lab Barcelona, the first Fab Lab in the European Union and a benchmark in the network of over 1800 Fab Labs. Over the last ten years, he helped scale Fab Lab Barcelona from a digital fabrication facility into an established research and innovation laboratory. He led Smart Citizen, a platform that opposes the traditional top-down Smart City model, empowering communities with tools to understand their environment. Guillem worked as a researcher on many European-funded projects, including Making Sense, iSCAPE, GROW Observatory, Organicity, DECODE, ROMI, or Reflow. He is also a lecturer in multiple IAAC programs, primarily at the Master on Design For Emergent Futures (MDEF).

Multidisciplinary maker and educator with skills in 3D design, 3D printing, metalworking, electronics, programming, biology, and extensive education experience. I have developed careers in the fields of biology, data science, and education. I am currently in transition to employment that uses my skills in digital fabrication, metalworking and electronics.
Iâ€™m an extremely capable self-learner, very sociable and would love to integrate in a team with shared values to have an impact in the world, preferably at local scale.

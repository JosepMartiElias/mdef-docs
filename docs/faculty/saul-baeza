Saúl Baeza is the Director of DOES, a design and consultancy practice that explores the potentials of materials through research and experimentation. DOES members act as creative directors in the ever-changing-material-world in which our bodies are constantly interacting. Their aim is to develop concepts that lie at the intersection between product and technology, fashion and identity.
Saúl is researching at TU Eindhoven and ELISAVA Research. He is also curating for Understanding Design, an association whose objective is to enhance the culture of contemporary and avant-garde design in Barcelona.
Saúl is also founder and editor-in-chief at VISIONS BY, a material culture centered magazine.

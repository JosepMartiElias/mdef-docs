Sara completed her studies in architecture at ETSAB (UPC) school and delved into crafting applied to footwear and textiles, which led her to explore the possibilities of non-conventional materials through various research projects. Sara has worked as a fashion and product designer locally, paying attention to the sourcing of materials from various industries and creating diverse collections. Her projects are centered around techniques and creation rooted in the agency of materials as living subjects and the relationship between objects and craftsmanship.

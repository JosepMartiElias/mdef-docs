### Things to keep in mind to have the best academic year

Be supportive. Encourage and support your fellow students. No one here is looking for your criticism, cynicism, advice, or judgment. (We can get those things on the rest of the Internet).

Share generously. Your stories and experiences may be exactly what another student needs to hear today to solve a problem or seize an opportunity.

Be constructive. We’re here to push each other forward and lift each other up. Find ways to help each other think bigger, reframe challenges, and stay curious.

Don’t spam, promote, or troll.  MDEF Barcelona 2022 exists to help you learn. It’s not a place to spam, promote, or bully anyone else.

Keep an open mind. Yep, this isn't your average University course - you wouldn't be here if it was. You are encouraged at all times to keep your mind open and flexible. Embrace change, embrace the unusual - and trust the process.

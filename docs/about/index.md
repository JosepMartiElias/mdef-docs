By joining MDEF Barcelona 2023, you’re also a member of Emergent Futures, our overarching community. You’ll be able to keep up with our MDEF Barcelona 2022 activity both here, but also in your main Emergent Futures Activity Feed (think about it as our own Facebook newsfeed with Course and other activity all in one place).

If you think a discussion is interesting to the wider community - why not open it in Emergent Futures?

Discussing coursework or an upcoming project or class, you can find support from classmates and faculty here in the MDEF 2022 Program.

Program overview
The MDEF program is outlined on this page. You can check back as new course information becomes available.
If you need to consult general program information, you can see the [program booklet](/https://fablabbcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MDEF_Booklet_2021.pdf/).

Here you will also find the reading list, infrastructure, materials list, and contact list.

### Things to keep in mind to have the best academic year

Be supportive. Encourage and support your fellow students. No one here is looking for your criticism, cynicism, advice, or judgment. (We can get those things on the rest of the Internet).

Share generously. Your stories and experiences may be exactly what another student needs to hear today to solve a problem or seize an opportunity.

Be constructive. We’re here to push each other forward and lift each other up. Find ways to help each other think bigger, reframe challenges, and stay curious.

Don’t spam, promote, or troll.  MDEF Barcelona 2022 exists to help you learn. It’s not a place to spam, promote, or bully anyone else.

Keep an open mind. Yep, this isn't your average University course - you wouldn't be here if it was. You are encouraged at all times to keep your mind open and flexible. Embrace change, embrace the unusual - and trust the process.

## Syllabus

The MDEF02 program will allow participants to continue their research and innovation agendas using a multiscalar, experimental, and realistic approach, and by turning the final projects developed in the first year of the master program into living platforms for academic research, business development, or direct impact in open source communities.
X Futures program will have three different approaches and the same number of possible directions after the program’s completion.

Projects’ outputs will range from:
1. the knowledge developed and its contribution to academia
2. setting up a business model plan, testing it and implementing it, and
3. creating an open-source community to enable the direct impact of their projects in the world. 

We offer a unique approach to combine these three dimensions in participants' projects and to support the best combination to increase their impact in the real world. We aim to incubate and accelerate projects, by helping them to scale and develop distribution and sustainability strategies aligned with the Distributed Design and Emergent Futures ethos.

### Fluid Structure

X futures structure does not follow a traditional academic structure, instead it  provides participants with:

Access to knowledge. Connection with the research and innovation agenda of Fab Lab Barcelona and ELISAVA Research. Participation in teams that are part of EU funded research projects, company collaborations and other opportunities to link students’ work with real world applications.

Mentorship. Assignment of dedicated mentors in relation to students’ projects who will be supporting and guiding their project journey. Mentorships will consist of bi-weekly meetings with mentors and invited faculty, as well as periodical presentations to achieve project’s milestones.

Infrastructure. Access to the infrastructure of IAAC and ELISAVA, including labs, libraries, shared workspace and machine use.

Connections to Networks. Link to an international pool of partner institutions, companies, faculty, governments and organizations that collaborate with IAAC, ELISAVA, and their partners.

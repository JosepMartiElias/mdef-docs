# Year 2

The second academic year of the MDEF allows students to deepen their training and further develop the final Thesis Project presented at the end of the first academic year. It also allows students to continue their research and innovation agendas using a multiscalar, experimental and realistic approach, and turning the final projects developed in the first year of the program into living platforms for academic research, business development or direct impact on open source communities.

The Master in Design for Emergent Futures Thesis Project has 3 clear principles:

1. Provide a strategic vision and tools / techniques for designers so that they can develop ideas and be able to translate them into real projects and in context.
Focus on the design of interventions in the form of products and platforms that seek to produce new emerging futures, previously analyzing the current challenges of society and industry.

2. Work at multiple scales to design and test interventions in the real world.

3. A multiscale, experimental, and realistic approach.

During the first year of the masterâ€™s degree, students will acquire a broad and informed vision of the impact of technology on design and culture. They will make prototypes and test some of these technologies in the different design workshops.

Students will continue with their research and innovation agendas using a multiscale, experimental, and realistic approach.

They will turn the final projects developed in the first year of the program into living platforms for academic research, business development, or direct impact on open source communities.

Thanks to the combination of academic, business, and maker approaches, students will be able to further deepen and develop their hybrid profiles created during the firs year, taking their development to a professional level.

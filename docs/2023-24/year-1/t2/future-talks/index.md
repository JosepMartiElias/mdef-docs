## Syllabus

During this Future Talk, we will explore three key questions: How do you identify your values? How do values exist in and support a community? How do values live in, and through, your work? Through the lens of the Distributed Design Platform, we will explore the idea of design based on values. First, we will discuss how the Platforms values (open, collaborative, regenerative, and ecosystemic) function in the Distributed Design community. You will then apply your own projects to the Distributed Design Platform Reflection Tree to better understand how values can support and inspire you in your design and creative processes. Lastly, we will brainstorm together about how you can design with values in your own projects.

**Keywords: Distributes Design, design driven by values, design for impact**

### Learning Objectives

- Understanding how design based on values functions in an existing community (the Distributed Design Platform)
- Reflecting on how values can provide a support structure for the design and creative practices
- Using the Distributed Design Platform Reflection Tree to identify key design questions
- Exploring how values can live in student’s own work

### Methodological Strategies

- Group discussion and brainstorming
- Distributed Design Platform Reflection Tree

## Deliverables

- Students are asked to submit their individual reflection tree task on the Miro board. 
- Students are required to respond to two questions (each with a minimum of two sentences and without a maximum length specified) on their MDEF websites. 
    - The first question is an open reflection on the Reflection Tree -- the tree is in its final iterations and we appreciate feedback on the tool itself
    - The second question focuses on the key takeaways from the activity.

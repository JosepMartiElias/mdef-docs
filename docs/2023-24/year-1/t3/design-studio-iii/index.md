## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with their  communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the programme.

**Keywords: Design Interventions, Community of Practice, Prototyping, 1st Person Research through Design, Design Space, Documentation and Communication, Alternative Presents, Emergent Futures**

### Learning Objectives

The specific goals are the following: 
- Grow and consolidate the relationships with your communities of practice
- Bring forth design activities with your communities of practice to further explore the area(s) of interest identified in Term I and II
- Deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for your journey in the Master program
- Reflect on the becoming, outputs and outcomes of design activities

## Schedule

=== "02/04"

    **Landing Kick off - Framing your first Design Intervention for Term III**

     **Goals**: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a first design intervention for the term.
     
      **Activity**: Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 2nd trimester. Present your personal alternative present. 
      
      **Deliverable**: A proposal for the first intervention of the term based on the alternative present created (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after).
      
      **Task**: Start preparing and carrying out your first design intervention.

=== "02/05"

    **Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability**

     **Goals**: Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts.
     
      **Activity**: To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions. 
      
      **Deliverable**: Visualize the socio-technical system of your project (updated Design Space). Show possible paths of growth with new or existing actors.
      
      **Task**: Create a scalability roadmap for decentralization using the strategies presented in class.

=== "13/05"

    **Alternative presents to emergent futures: Understanding your emerging profiles and roles.**

     **Goals**: Learn from a guest alumni’s case study on how a 1PP alternative present design research investigation can become a hybrid professional role radically different from their previous professional practice.
     
      **Activity**: Presentation and Q&A, extrapolating ideas, identifying milestones, turning points, roles and strategies undertaken towards your alternative present.
      
      **Deliverable**: Update your alternative present including a description of the roles you would like to have in it.
      
      **Task**: Update your bio section in your website with an adaptation of your alternative present and your roles in it. Continue developing your interventions.

    **MDEFest**

     **Goals**: MDEFest aims to celebrate the end of the Masters’ journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked on all year long.
     
      **Activity**: Sessions will last maximum half a day, can be digital or physical (with remote streaming), done individually or in groups (preferably) and can be in the format of a workshop, a debate, a visit, a meetup or any kind of format the students find suitable for this experience.

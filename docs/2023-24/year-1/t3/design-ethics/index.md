## Syllabus

In these two sessions, we will tackle an introduction to the philosophy of technology from an analytical perspective and the central theme of our relationship with technology will be explored: are we determined by technology or do we determine it? And if that is the case, how? And to what extent? Or is this perhaps a false dichotomy and should the issue be explored in a radically different way? We will deal with current topics in ethics related to technology and design.

**Keywords: Technology, Ethics, Design**
​​

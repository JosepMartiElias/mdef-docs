## Syllabus

The MDEF boot camp is a landing and setup workshop that will introduce students to the main ambitions of the master program. The boot camp format will allow students to familiarize themselves with the physical spaces where the program will operate and experiment (Studio, Lab, and neighborhood), as well as provide the initial tools to document and share their progress during their studies at IAAC.

From Wikipedia: “Boot camps can be governmental being part of the correctional and penal system of some countries. Modeled after military recruit training camps, these programs are based on shock incarceration grounded on military techniques. “

Do not panic: IAAC is not a correctional facility! And we will only use the best of the boot camp format to facilitate the learning process and the adaptation of the students to the program and the available facilities.

## Syllabus

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design. Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

Is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication, physical computing and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience for rapid prototyping.

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an “honest” mechanical artifact.

from 10:00 to 14:00 (16 per week)

Hands-on sessions guided by instructors

### Group work:
from 15:00 to 19:00 (16 per week)

Non guided sessions where students work on a task independently or in groups

### Structure and Phases

![](images/structure.jpg)


Class by class schedule of topics and activities.

### Timetable

Modality of each session (in-person, on-line, or hybrid, and synchronous or asynchronous activities).

**Tuesday 9th**: Presentation & Unpacking (I know what's inside)

**Wednesday 10th**: Disassemble(I’m not afraid of exploring)

**Thursday 11th**: Forensic (I know what I have )

**Friday 12th**: In-Control (I built something I trust)

**Tuesday 15th**: What to do with these parts (Beta devices)

**Wednesday 16th**: Integration of artifacts (I build something that works)

**Thursday 17th**: Field visit & recordings during the afternoon

**Friday 18th**: Final Presentations (I have a final machine)


### Use of the Master Infrastructure

The course will use the MDEF room at P102 and the FabLab Educational room to access tools and other space necessities. A big screen (proyector/tv) will be used for both students and teachers presentations.

The Communication department will provide equipment and team support on the last days of the workshop to asses the student on videography and filmmaking techniques.

## Materials Needs
All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.
Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers…

Do you have any old appliance (radios, toys, telephones, lamps, screens, keyboards…) at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too! (For safety reasons, avoid choosing appliances with a lot of power or that are easily heated)

## Deliverables

Students are requested to submit all the material requested by the faculty + their reflections about the seminar on the MDEF repository on GitLab https://mdef.iaac.net/ within a maximum of 1 week after the students’ submission deadline.

- Write a post out your weekly experience

- Deliver the forensic report completely filled

- Reflect your learning goals and possible applications of the technology learned

- Add link to the exploration tools and files you produced and used in your repo (Video and Slide presentation, Forensic report)


**All the students have to document their work for the course:**

- **Personal reflexions and learning outcome post** (personal MDEF webpage)

- **Video and Slides of the machine** (Google drive)

The deadline for the students to submit their work for your seminar is Sunday the **18th of November**.

**IAAC Grading System:**

• 0 - 4.9 Fail (submission of a supplementary work before the 1st term finish)

• 5.0 -6.9 Pass

• 7.0 - 8.9 Good

• 9.0 - 10 Excellent/Distinction.

Attendance and completion of submissions are mandatory, students failing to submit or not being present to at least 75% of the classes, without justification included in IAAC Terms & Conditions, will fail.

Students who submit after the deadlines defined by the faculty and coordination will be subject to penalty and the grade will be automatically lowered to a max of 5.0. Incomplete submission is considered a missing submission.

### Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop)
Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a "forensic report" of each artifact.

**Output: A written "forensic report".**

Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module.

**Output: A dataset**

### Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop)
Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing.

**Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows.**

### Almost useless machines (Experience workshop)
Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world. In the making, students will put into practice the fundamental stages of rapid prototyping in Fab Labs from building a mockup to integrating multiple digitally fabricated components into a working artifact.

**Output: A useless machine**

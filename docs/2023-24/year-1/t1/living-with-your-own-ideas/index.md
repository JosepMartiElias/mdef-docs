## Syllabus

Students will participate in a series of workshop activities that address challenges for quickly embodying concepts, and addressing them through lived experiences.

Throughout the week, students will engage in early and easy making processes. They will address the experiences of these things through the body. 

Each student will move through:

- Lo-fi version of their project/concept

- Different time scales

- Move from speculation to have a component of reality for their concept.

On the final day, students will present their experiences my means of videos.

**Keywords: Making with Magic Machines, 1st Person Research**

### Learning Objectives

In the course, students will experience the design process from a 1st person perspective by means of a series of interventions in their own life, with their own community. They will learn how to:

1. Do quick lo-fi prototyping sessions. 
2. Ideate through making with
3. Apply 1st Person Research to their projects
4. Document and communicate 1st Person Research through videos.
5. Reflect on the personal implications their projects imply.


### Materials

For the first day (Tuesday) please bring materials for tinkering like paper, old stuff., cardboard, textiles, scissors., tape, …

## Grading Method

### IAAC Grading System

| Grade       | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------            |
| 0 - 4.9     | Fail (submission of a supplementary work by May)|
| 5.0 -6.9    | Pass                                            |
| 7.0 - 8.9   | Good                                            |
| 9.0 - 10    | Excellent/Distinction                           |

*Attendance and completion of submissions are mandatory, students failing to submit or not being present to at least 75% of the classes, without justification included in IAAC Terms & Conditions, will fail.

Students who submit after the deadlines defined by the faculty and coordination will be subject to penalty and the grade will be automatically lowered. Incomplete submission is considered a missing submission.

## Syllabus

*A four-day seminar of four-hour sessions to kickstart designing with creative communities and engaging with the social body.*

Design practice and the role of the designer have been continuously evolving. What began as a practical discipline at the service of industry ("design over") expanded to include the perspective of the human user and their needs ("design for") and later evolved into more participatory approaches where the user becomes an active agent in the design process ("design with"). In the context of growing existential risks and challenges, it is now critical to push these questions further by incorporating principles of otherness, design justice, alterity, communities, situated epistemologies and intra-action into design practices.

### Learning Objectives

Students after completion of the course should be able to:

- Detect, understand and tackle complex issues through design practices.
- Engage with “creative communities” related to the matters of concern.
- Situate their practice in the field.
- Engage in strategic intervention.
- Get familiar and confident facilitating groups of people and processes.
- Widen their community engagement perspective and learn to work(in) non-human agents.

## Schedule

    ***9:30-13:30***
    
    **Class with Marta Delatte on Design Justice**
    
    Class with Marta Delatte on Design Justice
Rethinking traditional design processes and frameworks to prioritize social equity, inclusion, and justice. It would explore how design—whether in technology, architecture, urban planning, or other fields—can perpetuate or disrupt existing systems of oppression. The session would emphasize the importance of centering “marginalized” communities in the design process, ensuring their needs, experiences, and knowledge guide the outcomes. The class would be encouraged to critically analyze our work not as neutral but as an influential force for either maintaining or challenging social-political inequities.

=== "20/11"

    ***9:30-11:30***

    **Session with Laura Benítez on Other(ness)**
    
    In the first part of the session, we will explore the concept of "the Other" and its central role in shaping contemporary philosophical, social, and ethical thinking. The session will also introduce how contemporary debates approach the notion, experience, and construction of the "Other." (Ethics of alterity/otherness).

    ***11:30-13:30***

    **Visit to Salamina - eemeemee** 

    In the second part of the session, we will visit Salamina, a shared workspace in an industrial building in L'Hospitalet. We will visit one of the resident collectives, eemeemee [Enclave Micopirata Mutante], whose purpose is to maintain a community network to share processes and knowledge generated around DIWO mycology. Each of the participants in the network carries out on their own and collectively in the field of mycology and mushroom cultivation, both for food sovereignty purposes and for the development of tools for bioremediation of the territory or the discussion of ecological and interspecific relationships and hierarchies.

## Deliverables

### Session 1 to 4 - Theory

Students are requested to deliver a final presentation (with a digital record) that reflects around the process and learnings achieved. This presentation should present the final prototype/intervention proposal and evidence from its rehearsal. This might include: digital prototypes, videos, pictures, storytelling, etc.

Students will be asked to identify a creative community related to their matter of concern, research it, and frame an intervention towards this creative community.

Students will be asked to reflect through their blog on their personal disposition towards facilitation, identify their personal style, strength and weaknesses. 

## Grading Method

The course will be evaluated with a numeric grade that will average results from the 4 sessions.

### Session 1 to 4 - Theory

| Percentage  | Description                          |

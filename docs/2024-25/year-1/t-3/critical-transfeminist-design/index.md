## Syllabus

In these two sessions, we will tackle an introduction to a transfeminist perspective applied to design and experimental practices. How does it affect operating from a transfeminist perspective in design? Is it possible to design differently? What is? What are the ethical issues raised by these approaches? Is it possible to relate differently to technologies and through technologies? What happens to presences? And who is accountable for absences? Who do we relegate to a condition of subalternity? How do we deal with epistemic violence?

**Keywords: Critical Design, Transfeminism, Ethics of Care, Biohacking, Accountability**

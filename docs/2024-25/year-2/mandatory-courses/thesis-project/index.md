## Syllabus

The Thesis Project course is designed to support and guide students through the process of developing their final design projects during the second year of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. Throughout the academic year, students will engage in three key phases: Implementation, Validation, and Dissemination—each building on the prior to ensure that the project is well-researched, contextually grounded, and capable of being scaled for real-world impact. The course emphasizes interdisciplinary research, design methodologies, field engagement, and the creation of sustainable business models.

By the end of the course, students will have created a fully developed, scalable, and contextually situated project that reflects their ability to address complex societal challenges with innovative, emergent design solutions.

**Keywords: Prototyping, 1st Person Research through Design, Design Space, Documentation and Communication, Design Interventions, Alternative Presents**


### Learning Objectives

The specific goals are the following: 

- Develop advanced research skills to investigate and establish the scientific background of design projects, specifically focusing on the integration of emerging technologies and their impact on societal, cultural, and environmental contexts in order to develop their projects and practices as Alternative Presents to current challenges.
  
- Apply theoretical frameworks and methodologies to inform the design process and address complex challenges in emergent futures, with a particular emphasis on the ethical and sustainable integration of emerging technologies, situating their practices from a first-person perspective critically assessing scalable socio-technical systems.
  
- Gain an understanding of the social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence design implementation within specific communities and contexts, considering the potential implications and effects of emerging technologies on these factors.
  
- Promote design interventions encompassing field research and participatory methods to gain insights into the needs, aspirations, and challenges in the context exploring how these can be leveraged to create positive social impact


## Schedule


=== "Term 1: Implementation"

    In the first term, students will focus on conducting research and establishing the scientific background of their projects. They will delve into relevant theories,    methodologies, and frameworks to inform their design process. Students will gain a solid understanding of the context and theoretical foundations of their projects.

=== "Term 2: Validation"

    During the second term, students will shift their focus to situating their projects within a specific community and context. They will explore the social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the development and implementation of their designs. Students will gain insights into the needs, aspirations, and challenges of the community they aim to serve.


=== "Term 3: Dissemination. Scaling and Contributing"

    In the final term, students will work on the scalability model of their projects. They will explore strategies for scaling up their designs to reach a wider audience and have a greater impact. Additionally, students will develop sustainability and viability strategies for their projects. They will consider factors such as funding, partnerships, and distribution to create a comprehensive plan for implementing their designs.

## Methodological Strategies

- *Lectures & Seminars*: Weekly sessions on advanced research methods, design theories, community engagement techniques, and business modeling.
  
- *Advisory Sessions*: Meetings with academic advisors to provide personalized feedback and guidance on project development.
  
- *Peer Reviews & Presentations*: Group critiques and feedback sessions to foster collaborative learning and refine project ideas.

- *Fieldwork*: Practical fieldwork to engage with communities and gather insights for project validation.


## Grading Method

These are the points we are going to look at:

- Relevance of the project in relation to students’ positionality, situated contexts, and emerging challenges.
- 
- Framing and documenting the design opportunity of the thesis
Development and involvement of a community of practice

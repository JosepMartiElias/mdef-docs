## Syllabus

This course will examine the ways in which emerging technologies can empower individuals and promote a more coherent society. Through the lens of blockchain, cryptography, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), students will explore how these technologies can promote collective decision-making and reduce power imbalances on today's digital platforms. By examining the history and development of Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as the emergence of NFTs, students will gain a deeper understanding of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies.
​​
## Learning Objectives

•	Understand the potential impact of blockchain and cryptocurrency on society, including the implications for governance, finance, and social systems.

•	Explore the principles of cryptography and decentralized technologies, including the role of smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

•	Analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of decentralized systems, including their ability to promote collective decision-making and reduce power imbalances.

•	Develop skills in critical thinking and evaluation, as well as an understanding of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies.

•	Apply course concepts to real-world case studies, including examples of decentralized platforms, NFTs, and initiatives that promote collective control.

• Engage in hands-on activities to build skills in blockchain and cryptocurrency, including designing and deploying smart contracts and participating in DAOs.

• Collaborate with peers to develop and present proposals for decentralized systems that address real-world challenges.

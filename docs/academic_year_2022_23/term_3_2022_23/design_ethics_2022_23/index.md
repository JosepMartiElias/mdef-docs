# Design Ethics
### From Alternative Presents to Emerging Futures

## Track
Refelction

## Faculty
Oscar Tomico, Mariana Quintero, Tomas Diez, Jonathan Minchin

## Syllabus

In these three sessions, we will tackle an introduction to the philosophy of technology and the central theme of our relationship with technology will be explored: are we determined by technology or do we determine it? And if that is the case, how? And to what extent? Or is this perhaps a false dichotomy and should the issue be explored in a radically different way? We will deal with current topics in ethics related to technology and design.

​​**Objectives:**

•	To understand the nature of technology and its relationship with humans.

•	To know the limits and potentialities of ethical reflection.

•	To be able to reflect and assess the ethical dimensions of one’s own work.

•	To gain an awareness and understanding of ethics and its entailments for the design profession.

•	Get a sense of doing ethics beyond arm-chair ethics.

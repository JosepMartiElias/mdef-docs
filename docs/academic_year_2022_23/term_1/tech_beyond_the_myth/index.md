### Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop)
Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a "forensic report" of each artifact.
Output: A written "forensic report".

### Measuring the world (Experience workshop)
Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module.
Output: A dataset

### Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop)
Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing.
Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows.

### Almost useless machines (Experience workshop)
Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world. In the making, students will put into practice the fundamental stages of rapid prototyping in Fab Labs from building a mockup to integrating multiple digitally fabricated components into a working artifact.
Output: A useless machine

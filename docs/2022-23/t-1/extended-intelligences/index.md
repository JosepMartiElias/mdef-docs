## Syllabus

The first part of the seminar sets the grounds for designing witht/for/by AI in the current and future world conditions. The focus is on the conceptual basis of AI and how the practice of design has spawned a wealth not just of new possibilities but of new methods too. Poshuman, Postdigital, Smart Interaction and Multiple Intelligence (or chamanistic) design are explored and the basis of their methodologies are shared.

The second part of the seminar will be focused on Artificial Intelligence and contemporary visual culture. With a practical approach, and by learning some techniques and tools, part of the concepts learnt on the first part will be applied in class exercises.

A speculative project will be developed by the students in small groups during the seminar and will be presented at its end.

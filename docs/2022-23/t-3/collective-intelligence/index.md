## Syllabus

This course will examine the ways in which emerging technologies can empower individuals and promote a more coherent society. Through the lens of blockchain, cryptography, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), students will explore how these technologies can promote collective decision-making and reduce power imbalances on today's digital platforms. By examining the history and development of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tezos, as well as the emergence of NFTs, students will gain a deeper understanding of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies.

- Develop skills in critical thinking and evaluation, as well as an understanding of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies.
- Apply course concepts to real-world case studies, including examples of decentralized platforms, NFTs, and initiatives that promote collective control.
- Engage in hands-on activities to build skills in blockchain and cryptocurrency, including designing and deploying smart contracts and participating in DAOs.

## Syllabus 

MDFest is the occasion to present your research project to the outside world in participative format.

- Explore different event formats, approaches, and audiences

- Define the general theme, sub-themes of the festival and a Festival Title

- Explore & Map places, communities, & stakeholders

- Work together to identify the working groups & events

- Find connections between the different working groups and their events

- Define the formats, audiences & collaborators of each event

- Discuss the overall agenda and approaches to communication and outreach

Each week, we will start with a group session with inspiration material and a new group exercise. You will be able to work on it during the week and we will meet a second time to put this together and help groups during one to one sessions.

At the end of the sessions, you should be ready to go to the next step and start communication & logistics planning of the festival.
